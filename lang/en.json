      "subtitle1": "What Is Photogrammetry?",
      "text1": "Photogrammetry is an advanced technique that transforms two-dimensional images into highly accurate three-dimensional representations. By capturing multiple photographs of an object or area from different angles and processing them with specialised software, it is possible to generate dense and detailed point clouds — sets of millions of points that represent the real geometry of surfaces, structures or terrain.",
      "subtitle2": "How Does It Work?",
      "text2": "The process begins with image collection, usually performed by UAVs/drones or terrestrial cameras. From the overlapping of these images, the software identifies common points — called control points — and calculates their position in three-dimensional space. The result is a point cloud that accurately reflects the shape, dimension and texture of the captured object or environment.",
